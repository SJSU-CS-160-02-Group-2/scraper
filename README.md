To run, clone this repo, cd into it, and run this at the command line:

```sh
$ ./gradlew run
```

Or, if you're on Windows, use `gradlew.bat`, instead of `gradlew`.

To build, run `./gradlew build`. This will compile all source code, run the tests,
and put the compiled `.class` files under `build/classes`.
